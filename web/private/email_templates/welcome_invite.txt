Hi,

We are launching Wrte.io beta! Activate your account and choose where payments will go to: http://wrte.io/sendmoneyto

We are using Stripe for payments. It means people could pay by both credit card and bitcoins. Thatâ€™s why we have to change your paywall amount from bitcoins to USD. If you want to tweak it, you can do it here http://wrte.io/dashboard 

Wondering how you are going to use it. Here there are some ideas to start with:
     - Charge for you attention (e.g. journalists could charge for reading pitches)
     - Make your address public and get used of cold emails. Small paywall price (think of a post stamp), money can go to charity
     - Build services based on wrte.io, like http://tinytask.io
